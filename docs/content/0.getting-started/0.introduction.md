## Why use Nuxt Link Checker?

By keeping your links in check, you can ensure that your site is discoverable and accessible to [search engine crawlers](https://nuxtseo.com/learn/controlling-crawlers) and your users.

The most obvious check for links is that it's a valid link, but the module does so much more than that. For example, it
will guide you in setting up your links correctly, avoiding common pitfalls in URLs such as: whitespaces, non-ascii, uppercase,
non-root relative URLs, and more.

New to SEO? Check out the [Controlling Web Crawlers](https://nuxtseo.com/learn/controlling-crawlers) guide to learn more about why you might
need this module.

While it's simple to manually check your links, it can be time-consuming and error-prone to do so consistently, especially as your site grows. Nuxt Link Checker automatically scans your links during development and build time, catching issues before they reach production.
