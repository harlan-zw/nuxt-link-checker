## Why use Nuxt Link Checker?

By keeping your links in check, you can ensure that your site is discoverable and accessible to [search engine crawlers](https://nuxtseo.com/learn/controlling-crawlers) and your users.

The most obvious check for links is that it's a valid link, but the module does so much more than that. For example, it
will guide you in setting up your links correctly, avoiding common pitfalls in URLs such as: whitespaces, non-ascii, uppercase,
non-root relative URLs, and more.
