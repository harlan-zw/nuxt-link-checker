## Module Setup

:ModuleInstall{name="link-checker"}

## Previewing Live Inspections

The Link Checker only works in development mode when the DevTools is open or when running `nuxi build` or `nuxi generate`.

Open up DevTools in your Nuxt app and navigate to the `Link Checker` tab.

To start seeing live inspections, navigate to a page with links and open the DevTools on the `Link Checker` tab.

## Next Steps

It's recommended to use this module with Nuxt Sitemap so that your page links are automatically discovered.
