You can exclude URLs from throwing errors by adding them to the `excludeLinks` array.

For example, if you have an `/admin` route that is a separate application, you can ignore all `/admin` links with:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  linkChecker: {
    excludeLinks: [
      '/admin/**'
    ],
  },
})
```
