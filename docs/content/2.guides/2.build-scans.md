title: Checking Links on Build
description: See your link checker results when you build.
---

## Introduction

By default, links will be scanned when you run your build.

## Throwing Build Errors

When building and deploying your app in a CI, you may like to disable the deployment if
there are any broken links.

To do so you can enable the `failOnError` option. This will exit the process with a non-zero exit code.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  linkChecker: {
    failOnError: true,
  },
})
```

## Generating Reports

Check the [Generate Reports](/docs/link-checker/guides/generate-reports) guide for more details.

## Disabling Build Scans

If you want to disable build link scanning, you can set `runOnBuild` to `false` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  linkChecker: {
    runOnBuild: false,
  },
})
```
