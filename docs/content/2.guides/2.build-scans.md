title: Scanning Links on Build
description: See your link checker results when you build.
---

By default, links will be scanned when you run your build.

## Throwing Build Errors

When building and deploying your app in a CI, you may like to disable the deployment if
there are any broken links.

To do so you can enable the `failOnError` option. This will exit the process with a non-zero exit code.

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  linkChecker: {
    failOnError: true,
  },
})
```

## Generating Reports

To make working in a CI environment easier, you are able to generate a static
report of the broken links.

There are two reports available: `html` and `markdown`.

To generate them, you can provide the `report` option:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  linkChecker: {
    report: {
      // generate both a html and markdown report
      html: true,
      markdown: true,
    }
  },
})
```

The reports will be output in the following paths:
- `html`: `./output/link-checker-report.html`
- `markdown`: `./output/link-checker-report.md`

## Disabling Build Scans

If you want to disable build link scanning, you can set `runOnBuild` to `false` in your `nuxt.config`:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  linkChecker: {
    runOnBuild: false,
  },
})
```
