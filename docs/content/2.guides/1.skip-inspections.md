| `no-javascript` | Checks for javascript links.                           |
| `trailing-slash` | Checks for trailing slashes on internal links.         |

| `redirects` | Checks for redirects.                                  |

## Skipping Inspections

You can skip inspections by adding them to the `skipInspections` array.

For example, if you want to skip the `missing-hash` inspection, you can do so with:

```ts
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  linkChecker: {
    skipInspections: [
      'missing-hash'
    ],
  },
})
```
