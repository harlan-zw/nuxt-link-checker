This new stable release for Nuxt Link Checker introduces many stability improvements as well as a refreshed DevTools experience.

### DevTools: Scroll To Link

When you have lots of content on a page, it can be difficult to find where specific links are used on the page when an inspection returns with a failure. To make finding them easier, each inspection has a "scroll to" button which will take you directly to the link.

### DevTools: Refreshed UI

The UI has been refreshed to provide a more modern and clean experience, cleaning up many small issues and providing a more consistent experience.
